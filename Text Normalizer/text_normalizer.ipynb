Here we\\'ll get this data from wikipedia.\\n\\nHTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <h1> and </h1>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).\\n\\nAnother important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.\\n\\nThe following is an example of the classic \"Hello, World!\" program:\\n\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html>\\n  <head>\\n    <title>This is a title</title>\\n  </head>\\n  <body>\\n    <div>\\n        <p>Hello world!</p>\\n    </div>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\nThe text between <html> and </html> describes the web page, and the text between <body> and </body> is the visible page content. The markup text <title>This is a title</title> defines the browser page title, and the tag <div> defines a division of the page used for easy styling.'"
